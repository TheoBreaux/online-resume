            I'm an enthusiastic software engineer with a background in
            entertainment and hospitality. Currently pursuing a B.S. in Software
            Engineering at Western Governors University, I also hold a B.A. in
            Marketing/Advertising from Lake Forest College as an Independent
            Scholar.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a founding software engineer at Go Dutch!, I showcased my
            full-stack proficiency using JavaScript, React Native, PostgreSQL,
            Node.js and Express.js. My technical toolkit spans JavaScript, HTML,
            CSS, React.js, React Native, PostgreSQL, Redux, and more. I've
            refined my skills through hands-on experience, maintaining my
            ecommerce site, and independently designing various web
            applications. With almost three years in software engineering and
            five years in entrepreneurship, I bring a robust foundation in
            frontend development, data analysis, problem-solving, and
            innovation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Collaborating with diverse teams, I aim to contribute to the
            software industry's success and growth while embracing new
            challenges and opportunities for continuous learning and growth.
            Ultimately, I am excited and passionate about building responsive
            and performant applications that deliver great user experiences and
            make a positive impact on the world.
